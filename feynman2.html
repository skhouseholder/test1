<li>You can know the <a href="/wiki/Name" title="Name" class="mw-redirect">name</a> of a <a href="/wiki/Bird" title="Bird" class="mw-redirect">bird</a> in all the <a href="/wiki/Languages" title="Languages" class="mw-redirect">languages</a> of the <a href="/wiki/World" title="World">world</a>, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely <a href="/wiki/Nothing" title="Nothing" class="mw-redirect">nothing</a> whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing — that's what counts. <b>I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.</b>

<li>There is one feature I notice that is generally missing in "<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science" class="extiw" title="w:Cargo cult science">cargo cult science</a>." It's a kind of scientific <a href="/wiki/Integrity" title="Integrity">integrity</a>, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter <a href="/wiki/Honesty" title="Honesty">honesty</a> — a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, <b>if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid — not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked — to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.</b><br />
Details that could throw <a href="/wiki/Doubt" title="Doubt">doubt</a> on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can — if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong — to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more subtle problem. When you have put a lot of <a href="/wiki/Ideas" title="Ideas">ideas</a> together to make an elaborate <a href="/wiki/Theory" title="Theory">theory</a>, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.<br />
In summary, the idea is to try to give <b>all of the information</b> to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the <a href="/wiki/Information" title="Information">information</a> that leads to <a href="/wiki/Judgment" title="Judgment">judgment</a> in one particular direction or another.

<li><b>We've learned from <a href="/wiki/Experience" title="Experience">experience</a> that the <a href="/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">truth</a> will come out.</b> Other experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether you were wrong or right. Nature's phenomena will agree or they'll disagree with your theory. And, although you may gain some temporary <a href="/wiki/Fame" title="Fame">fame</a> and excitement, you will not gain a good reputation as a scientist if you haven't tried to be very careful in this kind of work. And it's this type of <a href="/wiki/Integrity" title="Integrity">integrity</a>, this kind of care not to fool yourself, that is missing to a large extent in much of the research in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science" class="extiw" title="w:Cargo cult science">cargo cult science</a>.
